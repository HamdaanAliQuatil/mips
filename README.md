<h1>MIPS</h1>
</center>
MIPS is a RISC based architecture which works on "Load-Store" Strategy.
<br>
1. Data is loaded from the memory to the registers.
2. The control unit is executed.
3. The result is stored in the memory.
4. The program is terminated.
5. The next instruction is fetched and executed.

<h2>Instruction Set Architecture</h2>
</center>
The instruction set architecture of MIPS is 32-bit. It has 32 registers. The registers are divided into two parts:
1. General Purpose Registers
2. Special Purpose Registers

<br>

<h3>General Purpose Registers</h3>
</center>
The general purpose registers are used to store the data. The general purpose registers are divided into two parts:
1. 32-bit registers
2. 64-bit registers

<h4>32-bit Registers</h4>

The 32-bit registers are further divided into two parts:
1. 32-bit integer registers
2. 32-bit floating point registers
