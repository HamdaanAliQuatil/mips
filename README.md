<h1>MIPS</h1>
</center>
MIPS is a RISC based architecture which works on "Load-Store" Strategy.
<br>
1. Data is loaded from the memory to the registers.
2. The control unit is executed.
3. The result is stored in the memory.
4. The program is terminated.
5. The next instruction is fetched and executed.
